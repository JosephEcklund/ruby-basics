What will the following program output?

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

Answer:  
These hashed are the same!


(This is because they are doing different accepted styles of the same key-value pairs and hashes are not sensitive to order, just that the keys and values are the same.)
