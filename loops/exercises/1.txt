What does the each method in the following program return after it is finished executing?

Prediction: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


My explanation:
The array was not changed but rather passed the value of the given element into the method which then manipulated the copied value as a variable.
