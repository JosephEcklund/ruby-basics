You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?



Solution:

It appears that the intention is to replace the name 'margaret' with 'jody'. 
names[] is expecting an integer argument in the brackets that points to an element position.  names[3] == 'margaret'.

To replace margaret with jody:

names[3] = 'jody'
